pMeh 1 divMB Supressor - Affects the stability of the frequency step if it is unstable without clear reasons. Remember those non-working frequencies like 2800? They are probably gone, but if you find any, try toggling this switch. It can also help in a situation when at a certain memory frequency, the console stops trying to boot into HOS, giving a black screen without identification marks. Also unlikely. It also slightly affects the overall stability of the frequency mode - generally. The value 3 is magical; it is more stable in most scenarios I have tested. On ERISTA, other than the value 3, 4IFIR treats as 0. On MARIKO, at frequencies above 3.0 GHz, the regulator value is excluded from the formula, as using values above 2 will drastically reduce stability or make the mode inoperable.
