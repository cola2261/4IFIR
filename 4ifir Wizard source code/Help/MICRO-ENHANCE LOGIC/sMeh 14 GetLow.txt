sMeh 14 GetLow - Control the degree of aggressiveness of the zero-jump algorithm, also known as 4VOLTSHIFT. The more aggressive, the faster the memory will switch to the lower mode, at the cost of an increased risk of not making it. In particularly tough cases, when you want to combine 300mV/900mV for the middle memory step (EMC - 4ifir Optimised) with 750/1400 for the upper (EMC - 4ifir Optimised S), you can try activating pMeh 15 eFOS MK. There will be a delay of two to three seconds when switching, but the probability of a successful transition is higher.
