pMeh 2 1333>1065>800 - Lowers the effective RAM frequency value on MARIKO for the Optimized E step. For maximum compatibility, the Target frequency and the frequency used for calculating timings and other dependent parameters remain unchanged (1331). It may be useful to reduce the working vMin for the E step of memory. In the future, it is very likely that the 800 MHz will improve in performance to stock level, replacing the 2XX MHz step.
